#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod A FileMunger has an opportunity to mess around with each file that will be
#pod included in the distribution.  Each FileMunger's C<munge_files> method is
#pod called once.  By default, this method will just call the C<munge_file> method
#pod (note the missing terminal 's') once for each file, excluding files with an
#pod encoding attribute of 'bytes'.
#pod
#pod The C<munge_file> method is expected to change attributes about the file before
#pod it is written out to the built distribution.
#pod
#pod If you want to modify all files (including ones with an encoding of 'bytes') or
#pod want to select a more limited set of files, you can provide your own
#pod C<munge_files> method.

version 6.032

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A FileMunger has an opportunity to mess around with each file that will be
included in the distribution.  Each FileMunger's C<munge_files> method is
called once.  By default, this method will just call the C<munge_file> method
(note the missing terminal 's') once for each file, excluding files with an
encoding attribute of 'bytes'.

The C<munge_file> method is expected to change attributes about the file before
it is written out to the built distribution.

If you want to modify all files (including ones with an encoding of 'bytes') or
want to select a more limited set of files, you can provide your own
C<munge_files> method.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.
