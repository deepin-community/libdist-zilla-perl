Dist::Zilla::Role::FileInjector - something that can add files to the distribution

=head1 VERSION

version 6.032

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role should be implemented by any plugin that plans to add files into the
distribution.  It provides one method (C<L</add_file>>, documented below),
which adds a file to the distribution, noting the place of addition.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_file

  $plugin->add_file($dzil_file);

This adds a file to the distribution, setting the file's C<added_by> attribute
as it does so.
