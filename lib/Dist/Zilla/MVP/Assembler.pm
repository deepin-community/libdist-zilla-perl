=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler - Dist::Zilla-specific subclass of Config::MVP::Assembler

=head1 VERSION

version 6.032

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Take this next bit seriously!>  If you don't understand how L<Config::MVP>
works, reading about how the Dist::Zilla-specific Assembler works is not going
to be useful.

Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler extends L<Config::MVP::Assembler> and composes
L<Config::MVP::Assembler::WithBundles>.  For potential plugin bundles (things
composing L<Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle>)

The Assembler has chrome, so it can log and will (eventually) be able to get
input from the user.

The Assembler's C<expand_package> method delegates to Dist::Zilla::Util's
L<expand_config_package_name|Dist::Zilla::Util/expand_config_package_name>
method.

The Assembler will throw an exception if it is instructed to add a value for
C<plugin_name> or C<zilla>.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.
