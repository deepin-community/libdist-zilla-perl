#pod
#pod This command builds and tests the distribution in "smoke testing mode."
#pod
#pod This command is a thin wrapper around the L<test|Dist::Zilla::Dist::Builder/test> method in
#pod Dist::Zilla.  It builds your dist and runs the tests with the AUTOMATED_TESTING
#pod environment variable turned on, so it's like doing this:
#pod
#pod   export AUTOMATED_TESTING=1
#pod   dzil build --no-tgz
#pod   cd $BUILD_DIRECTORY
#pod   perl Makefile.PL
#pod   make
#pod   make test
#pod
#pod A build that fails tests will be left behind for analysis, and F<dzil> will
#pod exit a non-zero value.  If the tests are successful, the build directory will
#pod be removed and F<dzil> will exit with status 0.

=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::smoke - smoke your dist

=head1 VERSION

version 6.032

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  dzil smoke [ --release ] [ --author ] [ --no-automated ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command builds and tests the distribution in "smoke testing mode."

This command is a thin wrapper around the L<test|Dist::Zilla::Dist::Builder/test> method in
Dist::Zilla.  It builds your dist and runs the tests with the AUTOMATED_TESTING
environment variable turned on, so it's like doing this:

  export AUTOMATED_TESTING=1
  dzil build --no-tgz
  cd $BUILD_DIRECTORY
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test

A build that fails tests will be left behind for analysis, and F<dzil> will
exit a non-zero value.  If the tests are successful, the build directory will
be removed and F<dzil> will exit with status 0.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --release

This will run the test suite with RELEASE_TESTING=1

=head2 --no-automated

This will run the test suite without setting AUTOMATED_TESTING

=head2 --author

This will run the test suite with AUTHOR_TESTING=1
