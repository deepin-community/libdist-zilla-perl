#pod
#pod   $ dzil authordeps
#pod
#pod This will scan the F<dist.ini> file and print a list of plugin modules that
#pod probably need to be installed for the dist to be buildable.  This is a very
#pod naive scan, but tends to be pretty accurate.  Modules can be added to its
#pod results by using special comments in the form:
#pod
#pod   ; authordep Some::Package
#pod
#pod In order to add authordeps to all distributions that use a certain plugin bundle
#pod (or plugin), just list them as prereqs of that bundle (e.g.: using
#pod L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs> ).

=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::authordeps - List your distribution's author dependencies

=head1 VERSION

version 6.032

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ dzil authordeps

This will scan the F<dist.ini> file and print a list of plugin modules that
probably need to be installed for the dist to be buildable.  This is a very
naive scan, but tends to be pretty accurate.  Modules can be added to its
results by using special comments in the form:

  ; authordep Some::Package

In order to add authordeps to all distributions that use a certain plugin bundle
(or plugin), just list them as prereqs of that bundle (e.g.: using
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs> ).

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.
