=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Prereqs - the prerequisites of a Dist::Zilla distribution

=head1 VERSION

version 6.032

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dist::Zilla::Prereqs is a subcomponent of Dist::Zilla.  The C<prereqs>
attribute on your Dist::Zilla object is a Dist::Zilla::Prereqs object, and is
responsible for keeping track of the distribution's prerequisites.

In fact, a Dist::Zilla::Prereqs object is just a thin layer over a
L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs> object, stored in the C<cpan_meta_prereqs> attribute.

Almost everything this object does is proxied to the CPAN::Meta::Prereqs
object, so you should really read how I<that> works.

Dist::Zilla::Prereqs proxies the following methods to the CPAN::Meta::Prereqs
object:

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 register_prereqs

  $prereqs->register_prereqs(%prereqs);

  $prereqs->register_prereqs(\%arg, %prereqs);

This method adds new minimums to the prereqs object.  If a hashref is the first
arg, it may have entries for C<phase> and C<type> to indicate what kind of
prereqs are being registered.  (For more information on phase and type, see
L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>.)  For example, you might say:

  $prereqs->register_prereqs(
    { phase => 'test', type => 'recommends' },
    'Test::Foo' => '1.23',
    'XML::YZZY' => '2.01',
  );

If not given, phase and type default to runtime and requires, respectively.
