#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod This plugin adds a C<=head1 VERSION> section to most perl files in the

#pod added after C<=head1 NAME>.  If there is no such section, the version section
#pod will not be added.

#pod Note that this plugin is not useful if you are using the
#pod L<[PodWeaver]|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodWeaver> plugin, as it also adds a
#pod C<=head1 VERSION> section (via the L<[Version]|Pod::Weaver::Section::Version>
#pod section).

=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodVersion - add a VERSION head1 to each Perl document

=head1 VERSION

version 6.032

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin adds a C<=head1 VERSION> section to most perl files in the
distribution, indicating the version of the dist being built.  This section is
added after C<=head1 NAME>.  If there is no such section, the version section
will not be added.

Note that this plugin is not useful if you are using the
L<[PodWeaver]|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodWeaver> plugin, as it also adds a
C<=head1 VERSION> section (via the L<[Version]|Pod::Weaver::Section::Version>
section).

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.
