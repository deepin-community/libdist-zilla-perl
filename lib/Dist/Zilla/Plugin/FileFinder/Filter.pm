=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FileFinder::Filter - filter matches from other FileFinders

=head1 VERSION

version 6.032

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [FileFinder::Filter / MyFiles]
  finder = :InstallModules ; find files from :InstallModules
  finder = :ExecFiles      ; or :ExecFiles
  skip  = ignore           ; that don't have "ignore" in the path

=head1 DESCRIPTION

FileFinder::Filter is a L<FileFinder|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinder> that
selects files by filtering the selections of other FileFinders.

You specify one or more FileFinders to generate the initial list of
files.  Any file whose pathname matches any of the C<skip> regexs is
removed from that list.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 finder

A FileFinder to supply the initial list of files.
May occur multiple times.

=head2 skip

The pathname must I<not> match any of these regular expressions.
May occur multiple times.
