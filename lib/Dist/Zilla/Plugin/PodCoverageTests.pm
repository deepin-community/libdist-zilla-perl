=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodCoverageTests - a author test for Pod coverage

=head1 VERSION

version 6.032

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Add this line to dist.ini
    [PodCoverageTests]

    # Run this in the command line to test for POD coverage:
    $ dzil test --release

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an extension of L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles>, providing the
following files:

  xt/author/pod-coverage.t - a standard Test::Pod::Coverage test

This test uses L<Pod::Coverage::TrustPod> to check your Pod coverage.  This
means that to indicate that some subs should be treated as covered, even if no
documentation can be found, you can add:

  =for Pod::Coverage sub_name other_sub this_one_too

L<Test::Pod::Coverage> C<1.08> and L<Pod::Coverage::TrustPod> will be added as
C<develop requires> dependencies.

One can run the release tests by invoking C<dzil test --release>.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.
