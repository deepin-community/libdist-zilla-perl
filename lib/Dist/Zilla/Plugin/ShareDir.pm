=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir - install a directory's contents as "ShareDir" content

=head1 VERSION

version 6.032

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [ShareDir]
  dir = share

If no C<dir> is provided, the default is F<share>.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.
