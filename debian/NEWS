libdist-zilla-perl (6.005-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From the upstream Changes file:

  [THIS RELEASE MIGHT BREAK YOUR BUILD]

  - Path::Class has been excised in favor of Path::Tiny, exposed as
    Dist::Zilla::Path; it will still respond to ->subdir and ->file, but
    only until Dist::Zilla v7 -- fix your plugins by then!

  - The --verbose switch to dzil is now strictly on/off.  To set
    verbosity on a per-plugin basis, use the -V switch.  Unfortunately,
    per-plugin verbosity seems to have been broken for some time, anyway.

  - The plugins [Prereq] and [AutoPrereq] and [BumpVersion] have been
    removed.  These were long deprecated.  (Don't confuse Prereq, for
    example, with the plural Prereqs, which is the correct plugin.)

  - [PkgVersion] now supports a use_package argument which will put the
    version in the package statement.  (Remember that this syntax was
    introduced in perl v5.12.0.)

  - Dist::Zilla now requires perl v5.14.0.  It will still happily build
    dists that run on whatever version of perl you like.

  - Using a Dist::Zilla::Path like a Path::Class object now issues a
    deprecation warning ("this will be removed") once per call site.

  [THIS RELEASE MIGHT BREAK YOUR BUILD]
  - all files now have content, encoded_content, and encoding attributes

  - Data::Section sections are assumed to be UTF-8

  - perform encoding steps during listdeps
  - by default, NextRelease now adds a trial release marker on trial

libdist-zilla-perl (4.101612-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream Changes:

  4.101540  2010-06-03 23:52:52 America/New_York

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

  New global config system!

  Your ~/.dzil/config.ini is now broken.  Running `dzil` should tell
  you how to fix it.  Probably just replace [!release] with [%PAUSE]
  and delete everything else.  Hope that helps!

  Major refactoring of our use of Config::MVP; this probably won't
  break anything unless you wrote your own config readers, which I'm
  pretty sure you haven't done!

  config parameters beginning with a colon are not passed to plugins
  (this should not really affect anyone)

libdist-zilla-perl (3.101461-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream Changes:

  3.101390  2010-05-19 09:15:32 America/New_York
            INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

            the as_distmeta method of Prereqs is removed

            the ->prereq method on Dist::Zilla is gone (only prereqs remains)

            distmeta is managed by CPAN::Meta, which expects v2 spec data by
            default

            most Dist::Zilla::Types are gone, now in MooseX::Types::Perl
